 In the app.use() method, it will catch all HTTP requests, regardless of the HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, etc.), as long as the URL matches. However, if you use {app.post(),app.get(),app.put()...more}, it will only match requests with the HTTP POST ,GET,PUT... method.

 In this example b is optional /ac and also work for /abc

 app.post("/ab?c", (req, res) => { console.log(req.body); console.log("data is sucessful saved in database"); res.send("sldkjkasd;sad dmaskndlksandlaksndkasndsandksandsadksadas"); });

 In this example url start with ab and end with c you can write between anything

 app.post("/ab\*c", (req, res) => { console.log(req.body); console.log("data is sucessful saved in database"); res.send("sldkjkasd;sad dmaskndlksandlaksndkasndsandksandsadksadas"); });
